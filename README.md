The Green corridor system is one way to expedite organ transplants and save lives. In this system, the traffic department collaborates to transport a vital organ in less than 60-70% of the time that is usually taken to go from place A to place B.

A â€˜green corridor' is a special route that is managed in a way that all the traffic signals that come in the route of the hospital where an organ is harvested and the hospital where it is to be transplanted, are green and controlled manually.
